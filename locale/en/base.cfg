[item-description]
refrigerater=Nuclear-powered refrigerator, slows the spoilage of items by a factor of 20(default) or your custom rates
logistic-refrigerater-passive-provider=Logistic refrigerator, can supply items, slows the spoilage of items by a factor of 20(default) or your custom rates
logistic-refrigerater-requester=Logistic refrigerator, can request items, slows the spoilage of items by a factor of 20(default) or your custom rates
logistic-refrigerater-buffer=Logistic refrigerator, can request or supply items, slows the spoilage of items by a factor of 20(default) or your custom rates
preservation-warehouse=Freezing warehouse, requires power, stops the spoilage of items completely
preservation-platform-warehouse=Space freezing warehouse, space is cold, so items inside shouldn't spoil, let's fix it! It provides bonus capacity to the space hub, only the increased slots will have freezing effect, these slots can be non-consecutive
preservation-wagon=Preservation wagon, your best friend for cold chain logistics
preservation-inserter=A fast inserter that slows down item spoilage while holding items
preservation-long-inserter=A long-handed inserter that slows down item spoilage while holding items
preservation-stack-inserter=A stack inserter that slows down item spoilage while holding items
preservation-bulk-inserter=A bulk inserter that slows down item spoilage while holding multiple stacks of items

[mod-setting-description]
fridge-small-chest-capacity=Set the item storage capacity for small fridges. Default to 24, minimum 1, maximum 96
fridge-large-chest-capacity=Set the item storage capacity for large warehouses. Default to 200, minimum 1, maximum 1024
fridge-freeze-rate=Set the rate at which fridges slow down item spoilage. Ranged from 1 to 100. 1 means normal speed, 5 means 5 times slower, and so on
fridge-power-consumption=Set the power consumption rate of warehouse (in MW). Default to 10, minimum 0.01, maximum unlimited.
fridge-power-capacity=Set the power storage capacity of warehouse (in MJ). Default to 3000, minimum 0.1, maximum unlimited.
fridge-space-plantform-capacity=Set the bonus inventory capacity for space freezing warehouse
